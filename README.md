# Hey there, I'm Owen Shadburne. 
I have plenty of projects here on github, but I also have some interactable projects on my [website](cubetures.github.io) and [itch.io](https://cubetures.itch.io)!

# About Me
I have 3.5 years of coding experience as of 2024, and I'm an expert in C#, Javascript, and Python, and very familiar with Java, HTML, and CSS.
I love software development and learning more about coding every time I start up a new project.
I have seveal years worth of projects, and the most notable ones can be found here on github.
