# Howdy, I'm Owen Shadburne.

I'm a passionate software developer with a knack for taking on ambitious projects like designing and coding a full-scale dating app, creating a custom cloud-based API for database and authentication connectivity, and leading teams to success in game development competitions. My experience spans web, mobile, and game development, and I thrive on bringing creative ideas to life, regardless of whether theyâ€™re personal projects or collaborative efforts. I love managing projects, I love mentoring others, and I'm continuously striving to be someone who inspires others to create.

The best of my projects are recorded here on GitHub, as well as on my [website](https://owenshadburne.github.io) and [itch.io](https://cubetures.itch.io)! Please feel free to check them out!
