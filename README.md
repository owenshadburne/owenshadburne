# Hey there, I'm Owen Shadburne.

I'm a passionate computer science student from Texas A&M with over 4 years of coding expertise and I have over 7 publicly available projects (which you can find just below). I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with professional-level experience in C#, JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java and in-depth knowledge of software development, data structures, and systems design.

The best of my projects are recorded here on GitHub, as well as on my [website](https://cubetures.github.io) and [itch.io](https://cubetures.itch.io)!
